# Phone-and-customer-tracker
This program takes 2 lines of 1's and 0's as input. The first line of input takes the number of customers and whether they ordered an iPhone (1) or a Samsung phone (0) and puts the customers in a queue. The second line takes into input the inventory of the store (1 if the store has an iphone in stock and 0 if the store has a Samsung phone in stock) and puts them into the stack. If the phone at the beginning of the inventory does not match the first customer's phone that they wanted, the customer is queued to the end of the line, and the program checks if the next customer matches the phone at the beginning of inventory. This keeps going until all the customers have been through the queue and none of them match the phone at the start of the inventory or until all the customers have received the phones they ordered.
